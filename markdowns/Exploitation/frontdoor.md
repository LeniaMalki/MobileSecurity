# Solution

## Description of the problem

The frontdoor challenge is a task that requires finding a way to access the flag without having the correct username and
password. The app prompts for a username and password, but the correct combination is not known.

## Solution

Unpacking and decompiling, we can check the MainActivity.java file as see that the flag is obtained through the
following:

````
String result = Flag.getFlag(username, password);
flagWidget.setText(result);
````

Heading over to Flag.java, we can see that the username and password does not really matter because
the request is sent out anyway.

Problems encountered:

1. `Cleartext HTTP traffic to 10.0.2.2 not permitted`
2. `android.os.NetworkOnMainThreadException`
3. Missing BuildConfig.Flavor

Number 1 can be solved my adding `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` in the manifest and number 2 was solved
by removing the thread restriction in the onCreate() method:

````
//Remove the thread restriction and override the default behavior
StrictMode.ThreadPolicy gfgPolicy = new StrictMode.ThreadPolicy.Builder().permitAll().build();
StrictMode.setThreadPolicy(gfgPolicy);
````

By inspecting the BuildConfig file in the decompiled code, we can see that it consists of just an empty string,
so we can just replace this line with an empty string in the MainActivity.java file. By connecting to the server,
we can simply get the flag after having resolved these issues.
